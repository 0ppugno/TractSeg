# TractSeg
 
![Alt text](examples/resources/Pipeline_img_for_readme.png)

Tool for fast and accurate white matter bundle segmentation from Diffusion MRI. It can create 
bundle segmentations, segmentations of the endregions of bundles and Tract Orientation Maps (TOMs).

The tool works very well for data similar to the Human Connectome Project. For other MRI datasets it works well for all
bundles except for the Commissure Anterior (CA) and the Fornix (FX) which are [incomplete sometimes](#small-bundles-like-the-ca-and-fx-are-incomplete).

TractSeg is the code for the papers [TractSeg - Fast and accurate white matter tract segmentation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.070)
and [Tract orientation mapping for bundle-specific tractography](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05580). 
Please cite the papers if you use it.

## Install
TractSeg only runs on Linux and OSX. It works with Python 2 and Python 3.

#### Install Prerequisites
* [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) (if you want to retrain the model you need v0.4, otherwise the latest version is fine)
* [Mrtrix 3](http://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux_install.html)
* [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation) (if you already have a brain mask and do not use the 
option `--preprocess` this is not needed)

#### Install TractSeg
Latest stable version:
```
pip install https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg/archive/v1.6.zip
```

#### Docker
You can also directly use TractSeg via Docker (contains all prerequisites). However, it 
only supports CPU, not GPU. 
```
sudo docker run -v /absolute/path/to/my/data/directory:/data \
-t wasserth/tractseg_container:v1.6 TractSeg -i /data/my_diffusion_file.nii.gz -o /data --preprocess
```
On OSX you might have to increase the Docker memory limit from the default of 2GB to something
like 7GB.

## How to use

#### Simple example:
To segment the bundles on a Diffusion Nifti image run the following command. (Diffusion.bvals and Diffusion.bvecs have to be in the same directory
as the input image.)
(You can use the example image provided in this repository under `examples`.)  
```
TractSeg -i Diffusion.nii.gz --raw_diffusion_input
```
This will create a folder `tractseg_ouput` inside of the same directory as your input file with one binary segmentation nifti image
for each bundle.
 
> NOTE: Your input image should have the same orientation as MNI space. 
Using the option `--preprocess` TractSeg will automatically move your input
image to MNI space (rigid registration). 

#### Custom input and output path and preprocessing:
```
TractSeg -i my/path/my_diffusion_image.nii.gz
         -o my/output/directory
         --bvals my/other/path/my.bvals
         --bvecs yet/another/path/my.bvec
         --raw_diffusion_input
         --preprocess
```
Use `--help` to see all options.

#### Use existing peaks
To avoid generating the MRtrix CSD peaks every time you run TractSeg you can also provide them directly by skipping the 
option `--raw_diffusion_input`.
```
TractSeg -i my/path/my_mrtrix_csd_peaks.nii.gz
```

#### Create Tract Orientation Maps (TOMs)
For each bundle create a Tract Orientation Map ([Wasserthal et al., Tract orientation mapping for bundle-specific tractography](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05580)). 
This gives you one peak per voxel telling you the main orientation of the respective bundle at this voxel. 
Can be used for bundle-specific tracking (add option `--track` to generate streamlines). Needs around 22GB of RAM because
for each bundle three channels have to be stored (216 channels in total).
```
TractSeg -i peaks.nii.gz --output_type TOM
```
Peaks and streamlines can be visualized using for example [MITK Diffusion](http://mitk.org/wiki/DiffusionImaging#Downloads).
> NOTE: Peaks have to be flipped along the z-axis to be displayed correctly in MITK.

#### Segment bundle start and end regions
Get segmentations of the regions were the bundles start and end (helpful for filtering fibers that do not run
from start until end).
```
TractSeg -i peaks.nii.gz --output_type endings_segmentation
```

#### Create trackings filtered by start and end region and bundle mask
Only keeps fibers not leaving the bundle mask and starting and ending in the endpoint regions.
```
TractSeg -i peaks.nii.gz --output_type tract_segmentation
TractSeg -i peaks.nii.gz --output_type endings_segmentation
TractSeg -i peaks.nii.gz --output_type TOM --track --filter_tracking_by_endpoints
```

#### Show uncertainty map
Create map showing where the method is uncertain about its segmentation (uses monte carlo dropout: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142)
```
TractSeg -i peaks.nii.gz --uncertainty
```

#### Perform Tractometry
See [Documentation of Tractometry](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg/blob/master/examples/Tractometry_documentation.md).

#### Use python interface
```python
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np
from tractseg.TractSeg import run_tractseg
peaks = nib.load("examples/Diffusion_mrtrix_peaks.nii.gz").get_data()
peaks = np.nan_to_num(peaks)
segmentation = run_tractseg(peaks)
```

#### Aligning image to MNI space
The input image must have the same "orientation" as the Human Connectome Project data (MNI space) (LEFT must be on the same side as 
LEFT of the HCP data). If the image orientation and the gradient orientation of your data is the same as in `examples/Diffusion.nii.gz`
you are fine. Otherwise you should rigidly register your image to MNI space (the brains
do not have to be perfectly aligned but must have the same LEFT/RIGHT orientation).
If you use the option `--preprocess` TractSeg will do this automatically for you. Otherwise
you can use the following FSL commands to rigidly register you image to MNI space (uses 
the FA to calculate the transformation as this is more stable):
```shell
calc_FA -i Diffusion.nii.gz -o FA.nii.gz --bvals Diffusion.bvals --bvecs Diffusion.bvecs \
--brain_mask nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz

flirt -ref tractseg/examples/resources/MNI_FA_template.nii.gz -in FA.nii.gz \
-out FA_MNI.nii.gz -omat FA_2_MNI.mat -dof 6 -cost mutualinfo -searchcost mutualinfo

flirt -ref tractseg/examples/resources/MNI_FA_template.nii.gz -in Diffusion.nii.gz \
-out Diffusion_MNI.nii.gz -applyxfm -init FA_2_MNI.mat -dof 6
cp Diffusion.bvals Diffusion_MNI.bvals
cp Diffusion.bvecs Diffusion_MNI.bvecs
```


## FAQ

#### My output segmentation does not look like any bundle at all!
Make sure your input image is in MNI space. Even if the input image is in MNI space the Mrtrix peaks might still be flipped. 
TractSeg is automatically checking for that and flipping the peaks if needed. However, in very few cases (~2%) TractSeg fails 
to detect the right flipping axis. In those cases you should view the peaks in `mrview` and make sure they have the proper 
orientation. Otherwise you might have to flip the sign along the x, y or z axis using the following command: 
```
flip_peaks -i my_peaks.nii.gz -o my_peaks_flip_y.nii.gz -a y
``` 
Using the option `--deactivate_peak_check` you can tell TractSeg to not automatically correct the peaks.

#### Small bundles like the CA and FX are incomplete
You can use the following three options to improve your results:
* `--super_resolution` The input image is upsampled to 1.25mm resolution (the resolution TractSeg was trained on) and 
finally downsampled back to the original resolution. Using `--super_resolution` will output the image at 1.25mm. 
Especially if image resolution is low parts of the CA can get lost during downsampling.
* `--bundle_specific_threshold` Lowering the threshold for converting the model output to binary segmentations. Instead of
0.5 use 0.3 for CA and 0.4 for CST and FX. For all other bundles keep 0.5. This will increase sensitivity for those
difficult bundles.
* `--postprocess` Will fill small holes in the segmentation and remove small blobs not connected to the rest of the
segmentation. (not working for output_type TOM)

Using those options will improve the results for CA/FX quite often. 

#### Did I install the prerequisites correctly?

You can check if you installed Mrtrix correctly if you can run the following command on your terminal:
`dwi2response -help`

You can check if you installed FSL correctly if you can run the following command on your terminal: 
`bet -help`

TractSeg uses these commands so they have to be available.


## Train your own model
TractSeg uses a pretrained model. However, you can also train your own model on your own data.
But be aware: This is more complicated than just running with the pretrained model. The following 
guide is quite short and you might have problems following every step. Contact the author if
you need help training your own model.

1. Install BatchGenerators: `pip install https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/batchgenerators/archive/master.zip`
2. The folder structure of your training data should be the following:
```
custom_path/HCP/subject_01/
      '-> mrtrix_peaks.nii.gz       (mrtrix CSD peaks;  shape: [x,y,z,9])
      '-> bundle_masks.nii.gz       (Reference bundle masks; shape: [x,y,z,nr_bundles])
custom_path/HCP/subject_02/
      ...
```
3. Adapt the file tractseg/config/custom/My_custom_experiment.py.
4. Create a file `~/.tractseg/config.txt`. This contains the path to your data directory, e.g.
`working_dir=custom_path`.
5. Adapt `tractseg.libs.DatasetUtils.scale_input_to_unet_shape()` to scale your input data to the 
UNet input size of `144x144`. This is not very convenient. Contact the author if you need help.
6. Adapt `tractseg.libs.ExpUtils.get_bundle_names()` with the bundles you use in your reference data.
7. Adapt `tractseg.libs.ExpUtils.get_labels_filename()` with the names of your label files.
8. Adapt `tractseg.libs.Subjects` with the list of your subject IDs.
9. Run `ExpRunner --config My_custom_experiment` 
10. `custom_path/hcp_exp/My_custom_experiment` contains the results
